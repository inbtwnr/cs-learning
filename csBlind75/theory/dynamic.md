# Dynamic Programming

---
 
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems that can be divided into overlapping subproblems, which are solved independently. The solutions to the subproblems are stored in a table and reused when needed. Dynamic programming is used to solve optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph or the maximum sum of a subarray.
